## Project was asked me at internship qualification process.

In the 2nd stage of your internship evaluation process, we are expecting you to
do a small project.
Using the USD/TRY Exchange Rate API URL below, take the last data of
“SeriesData” list, print the timestamp and exchange rate value into separate ​ h1 ​ ​ tag ​ in an
html document. Keep doing this process in an infinite loop in order to keep values
updated. ​ Code this task as a Python script.

In the html page you will create in 1st task, using Javascript’s jQuery library, take
the timestamp value. Turn this value into readable date-time format, i.e., ​ DD-MM-YYYY
HH:MM ​ . ​ ​ And print this readable date-time string into another ​ h1 ​ ​ tag ​ in the html
document.
Using javascript, make the html webpage refresh itself in every 30 seconds. So,
you can see the exchange rate updates.
